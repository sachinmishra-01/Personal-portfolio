        I have worked on a variety of web development projects, including a user-friendly coffee
        shopping website, a resume analyzer tool for job seekers, and a finance manager app for tracking 
        expenses. These projects demonstrate my skills in building responsive designs, handling real-world
        data, and creating useful web applications.
